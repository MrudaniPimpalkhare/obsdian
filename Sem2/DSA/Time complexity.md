1. Binary Search : Logarithmic time complexity, faster than linear
2. O($n^2$) : bubble sort
Algorithm for bubble sort

3. O($n!$): horrible time complexity (eg. permutations)
Travelling salesman problem:
A guy wants to travel every single city in a certain map such that the time is minimized. All cities are interconnected.
