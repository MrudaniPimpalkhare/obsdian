# Data structures and Algorithms

## Algorithm:

Set of well defined instructions to solve a problem. While coding, you code this algorithm into a function

Different algorithms are ideal for different purposes.
For small amounts of data, the algorithm doesn't really matter, as long as it works.
If you open your mind to larger amounts of data, what algorithm you use has a huge effect on the efficiency.
