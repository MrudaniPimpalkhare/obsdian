## Linearly dependent and independent vectors
1. Span of two vectors is the set of all their linear combinations
2. Linear combination of vectors - fix one, scale other : tip of the resulting vector draws a straight line
3.  In 3D space, the span of two vectors is a plane in which those two vectors lie.
4. for 3 vectors
- if the third lies on the span of the first two, then the span doesn't change
- else it unlocks the possibility of every 3d vector.
5. for 3 vectors: if one can be represented as a linear combination of the other two - linearly dependent
6. on the other hand, of the vector adds to another dimension in the span, they are called linearly independent.

## Basis:
The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.
